# Balatro Multiplayer 3P (fork)

This is a modified version of [Balatro Multiplayer](https://github.com/Balatro-Multiplayer/BalatroMultiplayer)
by Virtualized and contributors, licensed under GPL-3.0 (see LICENSE.md, unchanged).
Modified 2026-10 by Trust Ben Dover to support 3-player Attrition lobbies and a Steam peer-to-peer mode. It requires the matching
3P server fork (based on https://github.com/Balatro-Multiplayer/BalatroMultiplayerAPI-Server, GPL-3.0).
