# Balatro High Stakes

**[Balatro Multiplayer](https://github.com/Balatro-Multiplayer/BalatroMultiplayer) for 2 to 8 players** —
an unofficial fork by **Trust Ben Dover** (formerly "Balatro Multiplayer 3P"). Modes: **1v1 Duel**,
**Attrition** and **Showdown** (2-8 players; with 6+ players the bottom two lose a life), **King of the Hill**
(crown, bounty, crown shield) and **Teams** (2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 2v2v2, 2v2v2v2 with shared team lives), plus seven
special multiplayer jokers. Works over **Steam** (no server, no port forwarding) or with your own server.

> Unofficial fork. Not affiliated with, endorsed by or supported by LocalThunk, Playstack or the
> Balatro Multiplayer team. You need your own copy of Balatro (Windows, Steam).

## Install

1. Go to **[Releases](https://github.com/trustbendover/BalatroMultiplayer3P/releases/latest)** and download
   `BalatroMultiplayer3P-vX.Y.Z-Installer.zip`.
2. Close Balatro, **unzip** the whole zip, and double-click **`Install.bat`**.
   (SmartScreen: "More info" → "Run anyway". It's a plain PowerShell script you can read first.)
3. The installer finds Balatro, installs Lovely 0.10.0, Steamodded 1.0.0~BETA-1620a and this mod,
   and backs up anything it replaces. Choose **1 = via Steam** (recommended).
4. Start Balatro from Steam. The version (`0.6.x~3P`) shows in the main menu.

Everyone in a match needs the same version. The install folder is still called `BalatroMultiplayer3P`
and the mod id is still `Multiplayer`, so updating keeps your settings. `Uninstall.bat` restores your backup.

## Updates

From 0.6.6 on the mod checks GitHub in the background after the main menu loads. When a newer release
exists you get an **"Update available: vX"** button (top left). Click it and close Balatro: the updater
downloads the new Installer zip, verifies its SHA256 against the release's `SHA256SUMS` file, installs it
(your settings are kept) and tells you to restart Balatro. You can also run `Update.bat`
(in the Installer folder or in `%APPDATA%\Balatro\Mods\BalatroMultiplayer3P\updater`).
Turn the check off with `update_check=false` in the mod's `.env`.

## Playing over Steam

- **Host:** Play → Create Lobby. The host's Balatro runs the game server, so keep it open until the match ends.
- **Join:** Play → Join Lobby → type the code (wait ~10 s after the lobby is created), or use
  **Invite Steam friend** in the lobby / Steam friends list → *Join game*.
  If an invite doesn't land you in the lobby: Play → *Join Steam invite again*, or *Join From Clipboard*.
- **Rejoin:** crashed or disconnected? Join again with the same code and name — you keep your seat, lives and ante.
- **Late join:** another player (up to 8) can join a running match at the lowest ante/lives (not in 1v1 Duel or Teams).

Server mode (TCP) is still available: see [`server/`](server/) and choose option 2 in the installer.
